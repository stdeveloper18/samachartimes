                News is information about current events. This may be provided through many different media: word of
                mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of
                observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from soft
                media.
                <br><br>
                Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment,
                economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual events. Government
                proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed
                news since ancient times. Technological and social developments, often driven by government
                communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as
                influenced its content.
                <br><br>
                Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. Having developed in
                China over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. In the
                20th century, radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. Whilst in the 21st,
                the internet has also begun to play a similar role.
